# best_ever_footbal_players

This is a simple but interesting script that uses 'while', 'read' and 'printf'.
How does it work?
So, firstly the list of football_players is redirected to while loop.
Secondly, there is a command 'read' inside of while loop that reads the content of file 'best_ever_players' string by string.
Thirdly, each string is redirected by 'read' to an utility 'printf'.
Then 'printf' accepts strings from outside and makes relative substitutions.
