# best_ever_footbal_players

<p>This is a simple but interesting script that uses <code>while</code>, <code>read</code> and <code>printf</code></p> 
*** <br>
How does it work?<br>
So, firstly the list of football_players is redirected to <code>while</code> loop.<br>
Secondly, there is a command <code>read</code> inside of <code>while</code> loop that reads the content of file 'best_ever_players' string by string.<br>
Thirdly, each string is redirected by <code>read</code> to an utility <code>printf</code>.<br>
Then <code>printf</code> accepts strings from outside and makes relative substitutions.<br>
